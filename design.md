I'm not doing physics, so screw using meshes for that purpose!
Construction philosophy:
    Give me everything I need directly.
    or
    Give me something to generate it with.

Also, at any time you can set things.

game object
    model
        meshes
            vertex data
            Material
                Shader
                Data to put into uniforms (only that which its responsible for)
                    Textures
                    Other
