# Graphics Engine
I've been building my own graphics engine as I go through [LearnOpenGL.com](https://www.learnopengl.com)
  
It provides a programmatic framework to manage cameras, models, shaders, materials, textures, and game objects.
  
See demos on my [website!](https://www.benpinzone.io/#Projects)
  
Features:
* Instanced rendering
* Post Processing
* Transparent objects
* Normal visualization
* Easily changing vertex data layout
* Sharing vertex data between multiple objects
* Skyboxes
* Point, directional, and spot lights
  
Future Goals:
* Deferred Shading
* Shadow, normal, parallax mapping
* SSAO
