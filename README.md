# LearnOpenGL
I've been building my own graphics engine as I go through LearnOpenGL.com
  
It provides a programmatic framework to manage cameras, models, shaders, materials, textures, and game objects.
  
See demos on my website! benpinzone.io
  
Features:
* Instanced rendering
* Post Processing
* Transparent objects
* Normal visualization
* Easily changing vertex data layout
* Sharing vertex data between multiple objects
* Skyboxes
* Point, directional, and spot lights.
  
Future Goals:
* Gamma correction
* Shadows
* Normal Mapping
* Deferred Shading
